#Doctor Visit Analysis
Overview:    

Doctor Visit Analysis is a data analysis project that aims to explore and analyze a dataset related to doctor visits, gender, age, income, and various health-related attributes. The project focuses on gaining insights and understanding patterns from the data using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about doctor visits and relevant attributes for each individual. The attributes in the dataset include:

visits: The number of doctor visits made by an individual,
gender: Gender of the patient (male or female),
age: Age of the patient,
income: Income level of the patient,
illness: Indicator of whether the patient has any illness or not,
reduced: Number of days the patient's activities were reduced due to illness,
health: Health condition of the patient,
private: Indicator of whether the patient has private healthcare,
freepoor: Indicator of whether the patient receives free healthcare for the poor,
freerepat: Indicator of whether the patient receives free healthcare for the elderly,
nchronic: Indicator of non-chronic health conditions,
lchronic: Indicator of chronic health conditions,


Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

The dataset was preprocessed to adjust appropriate values for age and income. Rows with missing or zero values for income, doctor visits, and illness were removed to ensure data quality and accuracy.

Data Analysis and Visualization:

The project includes various data analysis and visualization tasks to gain insights into the dataset. Some of the key visualizations and analyses conducted include:

Visualizing the distribution of doctor visits based on income,
Analyzing the correlation between different attributes,
Investigating how income affects the number of doctor visits,
Comparing the gender-wise distribution of patients affected by illness,
Visualizing the average number of doctor visits based on illness type,
Analyzing the reduced days of activity due to illness based on gender.
